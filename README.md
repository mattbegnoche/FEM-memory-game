# Frontend Mentor - Memory game

![Design preview for the Memory game coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for purchasing this premium Frontend Mentor coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. These premium challenges are perfect portfolio pieces, so please feel free to use what you create in your portfolio to show others.

**To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Memory game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the Memory game either solo or multiplayer (up to 4 players)
- Set the theme to use numbers or icons within the tiles
- Choose to play on either a 6x6 or 4x4 grid

### Want some support on the challenge?

[Join our community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

### Expected behaviour

- You can choose to make the default screen either the Start Game screen or the solo player 4x4 grid. Note that we're using the solo player 4x4 grid for the design screenshot, so if you choose the Start Game screen, it won't match up in the design comparison slider. This isn't a big deal, but is something worth considering.
- In a solo game, track the time elapsed since first clicking on a tile and the total number of moves made. A move counts as two tiles being selected as a potential match. Once all pairs have been found, stop the timer and show the end of game modal with the stats.
- In a multiplayer game, track the total number of pairs each player has found. If a player finds a pair, increment their score by one. The current turn switches to the next player after the current player has made a move to find a potential match.
- Clicking "Restart" will restart the game with the current settings
- Clicking "New Game" will go to the Start Game screen where the player can choose their settings
- The icons in the design are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Please choose whatever icons you prefer. You could even use a different icon library, if you like.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. You can download the Figma design file on the platform. **Please be sure not to share it with anyone else.** The design download comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.

## Using AI coding assistants

We've included two files to help you if you're using AI coding assistants (like Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) while working on this challenge:

- `AGENTS.md` - Contains detailed instructions for AI assistants on how to help you with this challenge. It's tailored to this challenge's difficulty level, so the AI will provide guidance appropriate to your learning stage—offering more support for beginner challenges and encouraging more independence on advanced ones.
- `CLAUDE.md` - A pointer file that directs Claude-based tools to the AGENTS.md instructions.

**How to use them:** You don't need to do anything! These files are automatically detected by most AI coding tools. The AI will read them and adjust its behavior to be a better learning partner—guiding you toward solutions rather than just giving you the answers.

**Note:** These files are designed to help you _learn_, not to do the work for you. The AI is instructed to ask questions, give hints, and explain concepts rather than writing complete solutions.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/). **⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️: There are already a couple of `.gitignore` files in this project. Please do not remove them or change the content of the files. If you create a brand new project, please use the `.gitignore` files provided in your new codebase. This is to avoid the accidental upload of the Figma design file to GitHub. With these premium challenges, please be sure not to share the Figma design file in your GitHub repo. Thanks!**
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community).
2. Share on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in your post. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontend-mentor/).
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).

We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Please do edit them and include specific questions when you're looking for feedback.

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.

## Got feedback for us?

We love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve our challenges and our platform. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email hi[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

**Have fun building!** 🚀

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
